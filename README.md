# A class assignment: digital resume
 This is a repository for a digital resume & other some-to-come stuff.

## Bio
I am a motivated, inquisitive college student currently studying computer engineering and software development with a minor in mathematics. I am interested in computation, applications of theory to real-world situations, computer architecture, and compiler and operating system development. I am currently looking to pursue a Masterâ€™s program to fuel my desire for learning while also gauging my interest in later pursuing a Phd program.
